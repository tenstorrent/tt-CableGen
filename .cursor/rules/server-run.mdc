## Server Restart Policy

When the server needs to be restarted (e.g., after code changes), NEVER ask to kill and rerun the server. Instead, output a reminder that the server needs to be restarted and wait for the user to respond.

## Documentation Generation Policy

NEVER proactively generate documentation files (*.md, README, etc.). Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.
